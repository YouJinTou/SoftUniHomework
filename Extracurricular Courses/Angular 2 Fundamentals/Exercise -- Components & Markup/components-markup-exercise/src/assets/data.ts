        'Mysterious sea monsters that wash ashore are rarely mysterious (and never monsters)',
        'Sara Chodosh',
        'The ocean is a mystery and all that stuff. It’s a wild stallion to be ridden, it’s a woman to be bedded, it’s whatever trite metaphor you remember from an old timey book written by a man who didn’t really understand stallions or women. We can’t seem to shake this idea that the sea is a writhing, unfathomable mass filled with peculiar creatures never before seen. So every time some blob washes ashore, we all want it to be shrouded in watery mystery. What is this weird squishy thing on the beach? It must be a hitherto unknown creature! It couldn’t possibly be something ordinary, even though most of us have no idea what the majority of the ocean’s inhabitants look like and have no reason to think we can ID a new species. It’s just too kooky lookin’ to be boring!',

        'Rachel Feltman',
        'You wouldn’t think that the so-called gloomy octopus would be the stand-out socializer in its genus. Octopuses are notoriously bad at getting along with each other, and in almost all cases seem to live out their lives in isolation. They might fight for resources, and males are driven to risk a female\'s wrath in order to briefly mate. But other than that, they pretty much fly solo. Even devoted octo-moms, who basically spend their whole adult lives brooding their eggs, wander off to wither away and die instead of interacting with their hatchlings. As far as we know, anyway. These creatures are difficult to study, so scientists are only just starting to uncover their secrets.',

        'Joe O’Leary went to dinner with his parents at around 8 p.m. one Wednesday in March of 2015. He split a pizza, topped with tomatoes and peppers, with his mom. Then he set out for the gym and hopped on the elliptical. But about a half-hour into the workout, he started feeling weird. “My eyes were watering, I was having trouble breathing,” he says. “In another five minutes I was struggling to breathe. I looked behind me into the mirror, and my eyes were swollen—every part of my face was swollen.”',

        'The nice thing about bacteria is that they multiply really fast. This is inconvenient if they happen to infect, but useful if you want to see how evolution works. Put antibiotics on a Petri dish with enough bacteria, and a few days later you’ll find that a lone bacterium—one that happened to be resistant to the drug\'s effects—is now recolonizing the plate. It’s natural selection in action.',

        'Plesiosaurs probably took over the world using all four flippers',
        'Ellen Airhart',
        'Plesiosaurs definitely had a solid strategy for moving through water. These predators dominated the Mesozoic era, and lived for a thousand times longer than humankind has currently existed. But scientists are still working out exactly how these ancient Loch Ness Monsters got around. Everyone agrees that they swam—their massive, turtle-like flippers wouldn’t have been good for flying or clomping along on land. But researchers disagree about whether all four limbs participated in propulsion, or if just the front two did most of the work. To figure it out, scientists at the University of Southampton built a robotic replica of these flummoxing flippers. And in their model, at least, the use of all four is the most efficient way of moving about.',
