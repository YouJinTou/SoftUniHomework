Integrity constraints enforce rules that cannot be
violated.

Constraints:
- Primary key - the key must have a
unique value;
- Unique key - all values in a column or multiple
columns is/are unique;
- Foreign key - the value in a given column is a
key from another table;
- Check - the value meets certain criteria;
- Not NULL - a column cannot have NULL value;
- Default - provides a default value;
- Index - used to retrieve data very quickly.
