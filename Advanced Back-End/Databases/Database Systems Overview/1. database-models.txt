Models:
- Relational;
- Graph;
- Multivalue;
- Object.

Object-oriented model:
The database stores objects instead of separate
data values. This model is used when the data
at hand and/or the relationship between the 
objects is complex. Thus, this model should not 
be used for simple transactional data.
