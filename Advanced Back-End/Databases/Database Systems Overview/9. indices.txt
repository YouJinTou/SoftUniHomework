A database index is used to dramatically speed up
search operations in a database at the expense of
other operations such as deleting and writing.

Indexing methods:
- Non-clustered - the indexation does not follow
a natural gradation (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.) but instead
utilizes logical ordering;
- Clustered - the rows are sorted in order. Only
one clustered index per table is possible;
- Cluster - used when multiple databases and
tables are joined together.

B-tree:
A B-tree is a data structure that keeps its data
sorted and allows CRUD operations in O(log(n)).

Columnstore index:
"A columnstore index is a technology for storing,
retrieving and managing data by using a
columnar data format, called a columnstore."
- Microsoft

Spatial index:
"Used by spatial databases (databases which store
information related to objects in space) to
optimize spatial queries. Conventional index
types do not efficiently handle spatial queries
such as how far two points differ, or whether
points fall within a spatial area of interest."
- Wikipedia
