Primary key: a column or multiple columns that
uniquely define(s) a table row.
Foreign key: a column or multiple columns that
provides a link between the data in two tables in
order to control the data that can be stored in the
foreign key table.

There is only one primary key per row. This is not
necessarily the case with foreign keys.
