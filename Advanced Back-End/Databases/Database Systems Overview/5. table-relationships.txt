The main goal of relationships in relational 
databases is to normalize data, i.e. to avoid 
repetition.

The types of relationships are:
One-to-many - a country can have multiple cities;
Many-to-many - multiple products can appear on 
multiple orders;
Many-to-one - multiple cities can point to the
same country;
One-to-one - a country only has one president.
