Transactions are a set of database operations that
are executed as a single unit. This means that 
either all operations within it are executed 
successfully or nothing happens at all.

ACID:
- Atomicity - meaning indivisibility (all or
nothing);
- Consistency - all operations will be valid;
- Isolation - the result of the concurrent execution
of all transactions would be the same if they were
executed sequentially;
- Durability - once a transaction has been
committed, it will be executed regardless of what
happens afterwards

Transaction log:
The transaction log contains a record of all
transactions and the effect they've had on the 
database.
