SQL stands for structured query language. It is a
declarative language and as such is not a
programming language. Its purpose is to make
queries to a database. A sample SQL code could
be:

CREATE DATABASE demo;
CREATE TABLE adresser (
  adresse_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  gade       VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
  husnr      INTEGER NOT NULL,
  sted       VARCHAR(20),          
  postnr     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES postnumre (postnr)
);
